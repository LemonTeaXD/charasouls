# Charadex v.1.4

After Eclipse took out DeviantArt, I made Charadex to help other species creators organize and keep easier track of their masterlist.

And it's not limited to species! If you just sell adopts or what to make a little organizer for your characters - this might help. I use it to keep track of role play AU's and my own designs too!

Please note I'm not an actual dev and have absolutely no formal training. I've just been learning JS here and there and I feel like even jank code is better than no code LOL
