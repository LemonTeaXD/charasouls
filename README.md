# Update v1.3.5
- Completely redid everything. Because I'm nuts.
- Switched to list.js instead of pagination.js.
- Added a nicer pagination and added the ability to search.
- Simplified the google sheet, hopefully this helps keeps older/slower computers from dying.
- HTML for the general masterlist and cards can now be edited in the HTML page, instead of in the JS.
- Added the ability to add more info!! Like traits and junk.
- Died.
