# Charadex v.1.5.0

Charadex v1.0 is a tool designed to simplify the creation and maintenance of species websites.

By utilizing Google Sheets, users can generate logs of designs, items, player inventories, and other data, which is then utilized to create a user-friendly website that external users can easily navigate. Additionally, it can be hosted for free and is relatively easy to maintain and customize.

If you're interested in using this tool, please refer to the links provided below. I've done my best to write up clear and concise documentation.
